Abstract:

On-chip waveguide spectroscopic sensors have attracted considerable attention due to its potential for large-scale integration. However, existing waveguide gas sensors based on direct absorption spectroscopy (DAS) suffer from limited sensitivity and measurement range. Here waveguide-based on-chip photothermal spectroscopy (PTS) is demonstrated for gas detection with high sensitivity and large dynamic range. On-chip photothermal field due to non-radiation relaxation of gas molecules and the resulted photothermal phase modulation are analyzed. By selecting chalcogenide glass (ChG) as the core-layer material and fabricating thermally-isolated ChG-on-SU8 waveguide for thermal field accumulation, a twofold increase in photothermal phase modulation is achieved as compared to ChG-on-SiO2 waveguides. Different from the major concern of multi-path etalon noise in DAS, piezoelectric transducer noise in the interferometer is identified as the main source in this PTS. For a fair comparison, acetylene (C2H2) detection experiments are conducted using PTS and DAS with a 2 cm-long ChG-on-SU8 waveguide. A remarkable sensitivity of 4 parts-per-million (ppm) is achieved, which is 16 times better than that of DAS. The dynamic range extends over five orders of magnitude for PTS, â‰ˆ3 orders of magnitude larger than that of DAS. Such high performance opens the possibility of fully-integrated chip-level sensors for low-power, light-weight applications.
